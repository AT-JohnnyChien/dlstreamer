# Intel® Deep Learning Streamer (Intel® DL Streamer) Dockerfiles

Dockerfiles are used to build a Docker image.
We provide different dockerfiles for our Docker Images, seperated by supported operating system:
* dlstreamer.Dockerfile - dockerfile that creates the base Intel® DL Streamer Image using the APT packages to build
* dlstreamer_dev.Dockerfile - creates a Docker Image based on the base image with added development tools
